# slask-mcp — a small, readable MCP server in Rust

A minimal Model Context Protocol server built on the official
[rmcp](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) SDK. Three demo
tools, two transports (raw **stdio** and **streamable HTTP**), and optional
Bearer-token auth on the HTTP side.

It's a compact baseplate: small enough to read in one sitting, structured
enough that the patterns it shows — rmcp's `#[tool_router]` /
`#[tool_handler]` macros, an axum router with layered middlewares, Bearer
auth, graceful shutdown — carry straight into a real server.

## Tools

| Tool                | Does                                                                                               | Example call                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `echo`              | echoes a string back to the client                                                                 | `echo({ "message":"hi" })` → `"hi"`                       |
| `current_time_utc`  | current UTC date & time, ISO 8601                                                                  | `current_time_utc()` → `"2026-09-29T12:34:56.789+00:00"`  |
| `search_tools`      | case-insensitive search over tool names & descriptions, each match returned with its input schema  | `search_tools({ "query":"echo" })` → `echo` + its schema  |

## Quick start

Two commands to get it running — then poke at it.

```bash
cargo build --release

# stdio (default mode) — JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout; Ctrl+D to quit
./target/release/slask-mcp
```

```bash
# streamable HTTP
SLASK_MCP_PORT=9000 ./target/release/slask-mcp --http
```

One tool call over HTTP (no `Authorization` header needed while the token is
unset):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo","arguments":{"message":"hi"}}}'
```

## Client

`slask-client` is a **TypeScript** Node.js CLI that makes this server (and any
other MCP server) usable by a language model. It connects to the slask server
over streamable HTTP and — via a JSON config file with **no fixed limit** on
entries — to any number of additional stdio or HTTP MCP servers. It reads
`.env` and `mcp.json` from the directory it is launched in by default
(`--config` overrides the config path). To build and use it: `npm install
&& npm run build` in the `client/` directory, then
`npx slask-client …` from `client/` (or `node dist/cli.js …`; `npm link` for a
global binary). See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for the full
setup and reference. Two ways to drive it:

- **Agent chat** (`slask-client` with no args): a line-based REPL where an OpenAI-
  compatible model picks tools via function-calling, runs them, and answers. It
  works with real OpenAI or a local endpoint such as Ollama (no API key needed
  for local).
- **Direct commands**: `list` shows every available tool (with its input schema);
  `call <tool>` runs one by hand, with no model involved.

Tools from every server are merged; a name shared by two servers becomes
`<serverName>__<toolName>` on each, so the model and the caller never collide.
See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for the full reference.

## Configuration

Everything is an environment variable; only `--http` reads them (and a `.env`
file):

| Variable           | Default      | Notes                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `SLASK_MCP_PORT`   | `8000`       | HTTP port                                |
| `SLASK_MCP_BIND`   | `127.0.0.1`  | `0.0.0.0` to expose on the LAN           |
| `SLASK_MCP_TOKEN`  | unset        | set → Bearer auth required on HTTP only  |

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full table and
`.env.example` details.
