# slask-mcp-client

A Node.js CLI that makes MCP servers usable by a language model. Point it at
the slask server — or at any number of your own stdio and HTTP MCP servers —
and drive the tools it exposes either interactively (an agent chat using OpenAI
function-calling) or by hand (`list` / `call`).

## Setup

The client is written in **TypeScript** and compiled to `client/dist` by the
TypeScript compiler. It is a Node.js ESM CLI (`"type": "module"`) that talks to
MCP servers over streamable HTTP or raw stdio.

Prerequisites:

- A recent Node.js (v20+) with `npm`

### Install & build

1. In the `client` directory, run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run build` — compiles the `.ts` source to `dist/*.js` (what the
   `slask-client` binary points at). Re-run after any source change.
3. (Optional) copy `client/.env.example` to `.env` in the directory where you
   run `slask-client` and fill in your values (see `client/.env.example`). The
   client reads that `.env` on startup; shell environment wins over it.

After the build, `slask-client` (the package `bin` → `dist/cli.js`) is available
via `npx slask-client …` or a local install (`npm link`) from the `client`
directory.


## Start the server

Run the slask-mcp server on the same machine (or on any host reachable by URL). Default bind: `127.0.0.1:8000`, default path: `/mcp`. The server is HTTP with optional Bearer-token auth:

```
# no auth (default)
slask-mcp

# with Bearer auth
SLASK_MCP_TOKEN=my-secret slask-mcp
```

## Multiple servers (configuration file)

The slask server is configured with `--url`/`--token` (or `SLASK_MCP_URL`/
`SLASK_MCP_TOKEN`) and is always connected — named **`slask`** — in
addition to any servers you list in a JSON config file. There is **no fixed
limit** on how many you can add; each entry is a complete, self-contained
spec.

The default config path is `mcp.json` in the current working directory (where
`slask-client` is launched). Override it with `--config`/`-c` or the
`SLASK_MCP_CONFIG` env var. A missing *default* file simply means "no extra
servers"; a missing *explicitly given* file is an error. Copy
`client/mcp.example.json` to `mcp.json` in your current directory to get started:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "weather",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/weather-mcp",
      "args": ["--verbose"],
      "env": {"WEATHER_API_KEY": ""}
    },
    {
      "name": "calendar",
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9001/mcp",
      "token": "secret"
    }
  ]
}
```

| `args`         | ignored        | optional (stdio)| command-line arguments passed to the process                      |

**Tool naming and collisions.** Every tool from every connected server is listed once in the
OpenAI function-calling `tools` array. A tool whose name is unique across all connected
servers is exposed under its raw name. When two or more servers expose a tool with the
same raw name, each occurrence is namespaced as `<serverName>__<toolName>` (e.g.
`weather__forecast`, `calendar__forecast`), and the client routes each call back to the
server it came from. The model sees only the namespaced names, so there is no ambiguity.

**Best-effort connect.** Each server is connected independently. A server that fails to
connect (bad URL, token, command not found, timeout) is reported on stderr with a hint
and then skipped; the other servers keep working. The CLI exits with code 1 only when
**no** servers could be reached.

## Interactive agent chat

Run with no subcommand (or `chat`):

```
# local OpenAI-compatible model (e.g. Ollama), no API key needed
SLASK_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp API_BASE=http://192.168.68.73:11434 MODEL=gemma4:12b-mlx slask-client

# real OpenAI (needs OPENAI_API_KEY; API_BASE defaults to https://api.openai.com/v1)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-… SLASK_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp slask-client
```

On startup the client shows a banner listing every connected server (name, kind,
address), the model, and the full set of tools. Then it drops into a line-based REPL:

```
slask-agent > what time is it now?
  ▸ current_time_utc({})
      2026-10-01T00:00:00Z
  The UTC time is 2026-10-01T00:00:00Z.

slask-agent >
```

### REPL commands

| Command| What it does                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| /help  | show REPL help                                |
| /tools | list all tools (across every connected server)|
| /reset | clear the conversation history                |
| /quit  | exit the REPL (or /exit, /q, Ctrl+C)          |


## Direct, non-LLM commands

Run a tool without the agent:

```
# list every tool (across every connected server) with its input schema
slask-client list

# call a tool directly
slask-client call echo --message hello
slask-client call current_time_utc
slask-client call search_tools --query echo
slask-client call echo --args '{"message": "hi"}'
```

Warnings about unreachable servers are printed to stderr; the exit code is 1 on failure.

| OPENAI_API_KEY    |     | OPENAI_API_KEY | openai api key; only needed for the real openai endpoint (see API_BASE note)                                |

## How the agent loop works

Each user turn runs a bounded OpenAI **function-calling** loop (default: up to 8 tool
round-trips per turn):

1. The model sees the system prompt, the conversation history, and the `tools` array
   (built from `tools/list` on every connected server, with `$schema` keys stripped).
2. If the model requests tool calls, each is **routed to the originating server** (raw
   name or `<serverName>__<toolName>` when names collide), the text result is fed back
   into the conversation, and the loop repeats.
3. When the model produces a final (non-tool-call) answer, it is printed and stored in
   history.

A failed tool call (unknown tool, transport error, or a server 4xx/5xx) is returned to
the model as an `ERROR calling …` message so it can adapt and continue — the session does
not crash.

## Errors

Errors go to stderr; the process exits non-zero. Common ones:

- `no MCP servers could be reached` — every server failed to connect (all best-effort
  warnings were shown first).
- `tool not found` — the named tool is not exposed by any connected server (run `list`).
