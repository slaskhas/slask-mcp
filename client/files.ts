// files.ts — the client's built-in file tools: `read_file`, `edit_file`,
// `write_file`.
//
// All paths are resolved relative to the launch directory (the cwd where
// `slask-client` started). Access is hard-sandboxed in client code — not by
// the agent, not by the model. The guard has two layers:
//
//   1. string level — the resolved path must equal the base or lie directly
//      under it; absolute paths and `..` climbs (of any depth) are rejected
//      before any filesystem operation.
//   2. symlink level — for existing targets, the real path (all symlinks
//      resolved) must be contained in the base's real path, so a link named
//      inside the launch directory that points outside is also rejected.
//
// Every failure throws an `Error` with a message the model can act on;
// `runAgentTurn` (agent.ts) feeds any throw back into the conversation as
// `ERROR calling <name>: <message>`, so a refused path is a recoverable step,
// not a crash.
